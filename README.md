# PIZZA-licious

## Description of the Project
This project is a console-based Pizza Shop Ordering System 
designed to simulate a real restaurant ordering workflow. 
The application allows customers to create personalized orders through multiple 
interactive screens, including a home screen, order menu, pizza builder, drink selection, and checkout. 
Users can fully customize pizzas with different sizes, crust types, sauces, and toppings—including
meat, cheese, and regular options—as well as add drinks, garlic knots, and specialty sides.
## User Stories
1. As a customer, I want to see a home screen with simple options so that I can easily start a new order or exit the application.
2. As a customer, I want to enter my name and email so that my order and receipt can be personalized.
3. As a customer, I want to add items to my order so that I can build a complete meal.
4. As a customer, I want to choose the pizza size so that I can order the amount of food I want.
5. As a customer, I want to add garlic knots, seasoned knots, or potato knots so that I can choose from multiple side options.
